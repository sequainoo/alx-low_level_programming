formation from a given data structure.

## Linear search algorithm
---
they search the list of elements sequentially, visiting each element in turn until the target is found
or list is exhausted.
is practical when the list to search through is unordered and we need to search through it only once.
its not the fastest searching algorithm but might be the only feasible option.
When there is a need to search through the list more than once then it is sensible to reorganize the data
into some structure to aply a faster search algorithm such as binary or hashing.
