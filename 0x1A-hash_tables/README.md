#Hash tables

This project exhibits an important concept of programming hashing.
Which involves the use of a hash function and a hash table of some size

The use of hashing to store data as key value pairs is a tradeoff of time and space.
The faster the operations the more space required, the more space is in resthe slower the operations.

Hashing requires a hash function that computes a hash value or hash code that can be used to map to an array index in the has table.

a good hash function requires an evenly distribution of hash values of keys. Avoioding collisions any ways possible.
The less collisions the more efficient the operations involved.
